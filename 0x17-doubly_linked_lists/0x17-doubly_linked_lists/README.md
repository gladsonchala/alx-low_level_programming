# Solution to Tasks on Doubly Linked Lists

This repository contains a collection of C functions and programs designed to implement and manipulate doubly linked lists. Each file corresponds to a specific task that showcases various operations that can be performed on doubly linked lists.

## Directory Structure

The following files are included in this project:

- **0-print_dlistint.c**: Implements a function to print all the elements of a doubly linked list.
  
- **1-dlistint_len.c**: Contains a function that returns the number of elements in a doubly linked list.

- **2-add_dnodeint.c**: Provides a function for adding a new node at the beginning of a doubly linked list.

- **3-add_dnodeint_end.c**: Implements a function to add a new node at the end of a doubly linked list.

- **4-free_dlistint.c**: Contains a function to free all the nodes of a doubly linked list.

- **5-get_dnodeint.c**: Implements a function that retrieves a node at a specific index in the doubly linked list.

- **6-sum_dlistint.c**: Provides functionality to return the sum of all the data (integers) in the nodes of a doubly linked list.

- **7-insert_dnodeint.c**: Contains a function for inserting a new node at a specific position in the doubly linked list.

- **8-delete_dnodeint.c**: Implements functionality to delete a node at a specified index in the doubly linked list.

- **102-result**: A file that may contain results or outputs related to specific tasks or tests conducted during development.

- **100-password**: A file that may contain sensitive information or results relevant to certain tasks, possibly for testing purposes.

- **103-keygen.c**: A program that might generate keys or passwords, potentially related to the tasks involving data structures.
