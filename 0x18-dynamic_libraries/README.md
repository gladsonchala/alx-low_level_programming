# Dynamic Library - `libdynamic.so`

This project involves the creation of a dynamic library `libdynamic.so` containing a set of previously implemented functions. The purpose of this task is to demonstrate how to create and use dynamic libraries in C.

## Project Structure

The dynamic library `libdynamic.so` includes a collection of functions for basic string manipulation, character checks, and other utility functions. The functions have been previously coded, but for the purpose of this task, I created dummy files containing only the appropriate prototypes as defined in the header file.

### Files and Directories

- **libdynamic.so**: The shared dynamic library that contains all the functions.
- **main.h**: The header file that contains all the function prototypes.
